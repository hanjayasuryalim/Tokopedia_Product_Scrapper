<h2>How to run</h2>
I am using <i>virtual environment</i>, all the dependencies
already been froze into a file called 'requirements.txt'. 
Run `pip install -r ./requirements.txt` to install all required
dependencies into your virtual environments. After that,
type `python index.py` in terminal to run the program.
I am using <i>Chrome Driver</i>, it is already downloaded 
in `.utility/` directory.
